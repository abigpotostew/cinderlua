=========

Script graphics with Lua in a Cocoa environment lerveraging the Cinder creative coding libary.

This app is a personal educational app. This is my first time working with Objective-C and Cocoa. This won't be ready for release for a while. It's still full of bugs.


I'm using Objective-C / Cocoa for the interface and Objective-C++ for interfacing with Lua. I'm still trying to separate my Model View Controller setup more intelligently.
